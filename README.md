# QA-using-BERT

The primary objective is to advance the field of natural language understanding by harnessing the power of
BERT for accurate and contextually aware question answering. Extractive QA involves selecting the most
relevant portions of a given text as answers to user queries. BERT's bidirectional attention mechanism
enables it to consider both preceding and succeeding words, facilitating a comprehensive understanding of
context. By fine-tuning BERT on specific QA datasets, we aim to optimize its performance for extracting
accurate answers from diverse textual sources
